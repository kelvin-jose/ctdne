# Continuous-Time Dynamic Network Embeddings (CTDNE)

This repository contains the code for the CTDNE method, as described in the paper "Continuous-Time Dynamic Network Embeddings". The code implements a framework for generating dynamic network embeddings using temporal walks and evaluates the embeddings with a logistic regression classifier.
