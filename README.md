# Continuous-Time Dynamic Network Embeddings (CTDNE)

This repository contains the code for the CTDNE method, as described in the paper [Continuous-Time Dynamic Network Embeddings](https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3184558.3191526). The code implements a framework for generating dynamic network embeddings using temporal walks and evaluates the embeddings with a logistic regression classifier.
